# Frequently Asked Questions

### Feature X is missing
First, if you are looking for a feature complete package, I would recommand you to take a look at [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.or) directly. If you believe that a functionality/method/colormap is missing, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/braniii/prettypyplot/issues) and describe the missing feature and why it should be added. Alternatively, you can implement it yourself and create a PR to add it to this package, see [contributing guide](../contributing).


### I found a bug. What to do next?
If you find a bug in this package, it is very kind of you to open an issue/bug report. This allows us to identify and fix the problem, thus improving the overall quality of the software for all users. By providing a clear and concise description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it, and relevant information such as device, operating system, and software version, you will help us resolve the problem quickly and effectively. Submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/braniii/prettypyplot/issues) is a valuable contribution to the software and its community, and is greatly appreciated by the development team.
